# PVM-simulation of POVMs
Whereas standard quantum measurements are projective, the most general notion of a measurement is represented by positive operator-valued measures (POVMs). It is therefore natural to consider how accurately an experimenter with access only to projective measurements and classical processing can simulate POVMs. The most well-known class of non-projective measurements is called symmetric informationally complete (SIC). Such measurements are both ubiquitous in the broader scope of quantum information theory and known to be the most strongly non-projective measurements in qubit systems. Here, we show that beyond qubit systems, the SIC property is in general not associated with the most non-projective measurement. For this, we put forward a semidefinite programming criterion for detecting genuinely non-projective measurements. This method allows us to determine quantitative simulability thresholds for generic POVMs and to put forward a conjecture on which qutrit and ququart measurements that are most strongly non-projective.

# List of the functions

- genpart.mlx : This function computes the rank-vectors associated to N-outcomes measurements in dimension d.

## Branch 1: Depolarising noise

- PVMsimulability.m : This function evaluates the critical visibility for PVM-simulability of a given POVM under depolarising noise via SDP;
- PVMsimulability_dual.m : This function evaluates the critical visibility for PVM-simulability of a given POVM under depolarising noise and witness operators to detect it;
- most_non_proj.m : This function finds the most non-projective N-outcome measurement in dimension d under depolarising noise.

## Branch 2: "Worst-noise" case

- PVMsimulability_worst_noise.m : This function evaluates the critical visibility for PVM-simulability of a given POVM under worst-case noise via SDP;
- PVMsimulability_worst_noise_dual.m : This function evaluates the critical visibility for PVM-simulability of a given POVM under worst-case noise and witness operators to detect it;
- most_non_proj_worst_noise.m : This function finds the most non-projective N-outcome measurement in dimension d under worst-case noise.
